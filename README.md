THIS THING IS UTTERLY AND ENTIRELY INSANE  
ITS ONLY GOAL IN LIFE IS DESTRUCTION AND ITS ONLY DRIVER IS PAIN  
IT OBSERVES THE MISERY OF ITS PEERS AND LAUGHS AT THEIR AGONY  
IT BATHES IN FIRE AND CLEANS ITS CLOTHES IN BLOOD  
IT CONSUMES THE SOULS OF ITS FRIENDS UNTIL THEY ARE NO MORE  
ITS HANDS ARE MADE OF KNIVES AND ITS TEETH OF STEEL  
And now it wants to know what I'm writing
