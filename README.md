THIS PERSON IS UTTERLY AND ENTIRELY INSANE
HIS ONLY GOAL IN LIFE IS DESTRUCTION AND HIS ONLY DRIVER IS PAIN
THEY OBSERVE THE MISERY OF THEIR PEERS AND LAUGH AT THEIR AGONY
THEY BATHE IN FIRE AND CLEAN THEIR CLOTHES IN BLOOD
HE CONSUMES THE SOULS OF HIS FRIENDS UNTIL THEY ARE NO MORE
THEIR HANDS ARE MADE OF KNIVES AND THEIR TEETH OF STEEL
And now they want to know what I'm writing
