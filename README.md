THIS MAN IS UTTERLY AND ENTIRELY INSANE
HIS ONLY GOAL IN LIFE IS DESTRUCTION AND HIS ONLY DRIVER IS PAIN
HE OBSERVES THE MISERY OF HIS PEERS AND LAUGHS AT THEIR AGONY
HE BATHES IN FIRE AND CLEANS HIS CLOTHES IN BLOOD
HE CONSUMES THE SOULS OF HIS FRIENDS UNTIL THEY ARE NO MORE
HIS HANDS ARE MADE OF KNIVES AND HIS TEETH OF STEEL
And now he wants to know what I'm writing
